### Time Series Forecasting : Extrapolation
Having known the level of association between the dependent and dependent variables from analysis about the passt, making predictions about the future, also known as `Extrapolation` is possible.
This is truest especially in the classical statistical modelling of time series data.

More modern fields focus on the topic and refer to it as time series forecasting.

Forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future observations.

Descriptive models can borrow for the future (i.e. to smooth or remove noise), they only seek to best describe the data.
