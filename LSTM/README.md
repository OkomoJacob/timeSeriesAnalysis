### Time Series Forecasting : Extrapolation
Having known the level of association between the dependent and dependent variables from analysis about the passt, making predictions about the future, also known as `Extrapolation`, but lately refered to as `time series forecasting`. is possible.
This is truest especially in the classical statistical modelling of time series data.

This statistical Modelling involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future observations(Of course based on previous Records)

Descriptive models can borrow for the future (i.e. to smooth or remove noise), they only seek to best describe the data.

### Long Short-Term Memory Network(LSTM-NN)
<hr>

The Long Short-Term Memory network, or LSTM network, is a recurrent neural network that is trained using Backpropagation Through Time and overcomes the vanishing gradient problem.

As such, it can be used to create large recurrent networks that in turn can be used to address difficult sequence problems in machine learning and achieve state-of-the-art results.

Instead of neurons, LSTM networks have memory blocks that are connected through layers.

A block has components that make it smarter than a classical neuron and a memory for recent sequences. A block contains gates that manage the block’s state and output. A block operates upon an input sequence and each gate within a block uses the sigmoid activation units to control whether they are triggered or not, making the change of state and addition of information flowing through the block conditional.
